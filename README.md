Minimal but flexible Lavalink API wrapper.


This wrapper aims to be:
- Framework-independent. You don't have to specifically use Discord.js or eris to use this library.
- Correct. This wrapper should implement the Lavalink API correctly.
- Fast. This wrapper should be fast enough to be viable. However, correctness comes first.
- Minimal. This wrapper should be as minimal as possible - if possible, it should map 1:1 to Lavalink API.
- Consistent. The API should stay consistent with Lavalink's specification.
- Debuggable. Errors should be easy to spot and if there is any, the stack trace should be informative and actually be helpful.
- Readable. The wrapper should be easy-to-understand and readable. Code style should be consistent.


### Why another wrapper?
Because why not?

### Issues
Here are some tips from me:
- Before asking, you should try using GitHub search to search for relevant keywords in the repository. It would greatly help with finding where the error originated. If possible, try to understand what is happening under the hood. This would really help to find issues.
- [Try to ask a good question(at least try goddammit)](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask). Don't just go flaming people over "Why isn't this implemented?" or similiar topics. If you have the time to complain, probably contribute instead?


With that said, you are welcomed to ask in Github Issues. You can also ask in [this Discord server which I may check sometimes](https://discordapp.com/invite/FVqbtGu).

### Contribution
Always welcomed. I am a student so I don't have time for everything. PRs are always welcomed. Make sure your PR makes sense, unlike [_some_](https://github.com/Deivu/Shoukaku/pull/11).


### Is this a ship(girl)?
That is up to your intepretation. I prefer the shipgirl version though.
